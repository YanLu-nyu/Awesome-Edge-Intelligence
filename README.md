# Edge Intelligence
Intelligent Edge computing research notes
## Definitions
### Edge Compution
Edge computing refers to the enabling techniques allowing computation to be performed at the edge of the network on downstream data on behalf of cloud services and upstream data on behalf of IoT services. Here we define “edge” as any computing and network resources along the path between data sources and cloud data centers. <br>
